<a name = "nodetest"></a> <b>Nodetest</b><br>
<i>Synopsis:</i> A low-level test program meant for functional testing of RF modules (either your own custom-manufactured devices or those provided in the kits from Ember), including token viewing/programming, range testing, RSSI measurement, and special test modes of transmission as required for FCC and CE certification. <br>
<br>
<i>Roles:</i>
<ul>
<li> Device Under Test (DUT) -- The primary device undergoing functional testing.  You will probably want to also load Nodetest to a node that you are sure is working correctly (often called the "Golden Node") so that you can verify proper communication and comparison between the DUT and the Golden Node when each are running Nodetest.
</ul>
<i>Buttons Used:</i> None
<br>
<br>
<i>Serial baud rates, ports used:</i> <br>
The EM35x version of Nodetest runs at 115200 bps. Active serial port is auto-detected; whichever of the UART or virtual UART first detects a Carrier Return (\r), Line Feed (\n), or asterisk ('*') character will become the port used until the application is reset.
<br>
<br>
<i>Serial commands supported:</i> <br>
This application supports different commands depending on the hardware platform being used.  Use the <b>HELP</b> or <b>?</b> command to get a listing of all supported commands on the current device's platform.
<br>
<br>
<i>Notes and Limitations:</i> 
<ul>
<li>This application is provided in pre-built form only.
<li>The packets transmitted by Nodetest are raw packets sent by the radio without the aid of a networking stack, so 802.15.4 and ZigBee conventions, such as CSMA-CA algorithms, random backoffs, transmission retries and MAC and Network Layer packet headers, do not apply in this context.  Such test conditions can produce very different results when comparing reliability of communication to a test case involving two (or more) devices running a full ZigBee networking stack.  Therefore, it is recommended that you perform interference testing, coexistence testing and reliability testing with your own application (based on the networking stack) in addition to any similar testing done with Rangtest, so that your results are more representative of a true networking scenario.
<li>Packets transmitted by Nodetest are of a fixed size (the minimum size allowed by the radio) and are always transmitted at a fixed rate.  (This rate may be different for different radios; see program output for details.)
<li>This application is not intended for use in operating networks.  Use by nodes in a network will result in packet collisions and lost traffic.  This application can be used by multiple nodes at the same time where one node sends packets and multiple other nodes receive the traffic.
<li> This application is defined with NULL_BTL (no bootloader) by default.
</ul>

<a name = "sensor-host"></a> <b>Sensor-host & Sink-host</b><br>
<i>Synopsis:</i> An example of a complete application that implements a distributed sensor network with 1 or more data collection points (called "sensors") and 1 or more data storage points (called "sinks").  Each Sink broadcasts its identity (EUI64 address) via a Transport-layer multicast message (the SINK_ADVERTISE message in this application), along with a temporary reply route, to nearby Sensor nodes, who can then set up a binding to the Sink and send a request (the SENSOR_SELECT_SINK message) for attachment to that Sink.  If the Sink agrees to accept data from a particular Sensor, the Sensor recieves a confirmation message (SINK_READY) and begins transmitting data reports (DATA) to the Sink at fixed intervals (as set by SEND_DATA_RATE). Sleepy-sensors and Mobile-sensors can request a SINK_ADVERTISE message by sending a SINK_QUERY to their parent, since they may be sleeping when the SINK_ADVERTISE multicast is sent out.<br>
<br>
<i>Roles:</i> 
<ul>
	<li>Sensor -- A device that takes data readings from some input source and passes these readings to a particular collection point.  Many Sensors report to a single Sink.
	<li>Sink -- A device that serves as a collection point for 1 or more Sensor devices.  In this example, the Sink is set up to be the ZigBee Coordinator device, and it forms the network automatically on first startup and retains this settings across reboots.  (See Notes section below if wanting to use multiple Sinks in a network.)
        <li>Sleepy-Sensor -- A sleeping version of the Sensor application. Battery powered devices must sleep in order to extend their battery life. 
        <li>Mobile-Sensor -- A sleeping and mobile version of the Sensor application.
</ul>
<i>Buttons used:</i> <br>
<ul>
<li>BUTTON 0: If the device is not joined to a network, pressing this causes the device to search for an available network and join it if possible.  After it has successfully joined a network, pressing this button will cause the device to permit joining (accepting other devices into the network) for the next 60 seconds. Note that sink devices form networks automatically if they are not part of a network and this button will only permit joining on a sink.
<li>BUTTON 1: Causes the device to leave the ZigBee network.
</ul>
<br>
<i>Serial baud rates, ports used:</i><br>
115200 bps on UART1 for all devices
<br>
<br>
<i>Serial commands supported on all:</i><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>?</b> - prints the help menu
	<li><b>i</b> - prints info about this node including channel, power, and app
	<li><b>l</b> - tells the node to send a multicast hello packet.
	<li><b>a</b> - print address table
	<li><b>m</b> - print multicast table
	<li><b>0</b> - simulate button 0: attempt join or if already joined, turn on permit join for 60 sec (note sinks form and this button does not attempt to join)
	<li><b>1</b> - simulate button 1: leave ZigBee network
	<li><b>r</b> - reset node
	<li><b>k</b> - print the security keys
	<li><b>b</b> - put the host processor into bootloader
</ul>
<i>Serial commands supported on sensor and sink only:</i><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>c</b> - print child table
</ul>
<i>Serial commands supported on sink only:</i><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>f</b> - force the sink to advertise
	<li><b>*</b> - switch the network key: send the key followed by a switch key command 30 seconds later
	<li><b>&</b> - send a switch key command. This is needed only if the device sent a new key and then reset before it was able to send the switch key command
</ul>
<i>Serial commands supported on sleepy-sensor and mobile-sensor only:</i><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>s</b> - turn on sleeping when not joined
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<i>Notes and Limitations:</i> 
<ul>
	<li>This application defaults to using a fixed set of network parameters, with a default channel setting of 26.  (Remove the <b>#define USE_HARDCODED_NETWORK_SETTINGS</b> line in the common.h header file to allow the application to dynamically select its network parameters.)
<li>Although the example portrays a single Sink node that acts as a ZigBee Coordinator, the application could be easily adapted to allow a variant of the Sink node that joins the network as an ordinary ZigBee Router so that multiple Sinks can be supported.
<li>This application uses a "push" style of communication, where the Sensor sends reports to the Sink without needing to be asked for this data.  This is more efficient than a "pull" model, where a device only transmits data when asked to do so by another device, because it cuts the amount of traffic in half, thereby reducing the number of collisions and routing burden in the network.
<br>
<li>The data reports used in this example are fixed size packets (of a size defined by SEND_DATA_SIZE).  The data contents are simply a 16-bit random pattern (generated for each message) that is repeated as many times as necessary to fill the packet to its required size.
<li>The application uses a constant called MISS_PACKET_TOLERANCE as a threshold for fault tolerance.  On the Sensor, this controls how many message timeouts can be permitted between the Sensor and Sink before the Sensor decides to attach itself to a different Sink.  For a Sink, this controls how many data reports can be missed from a Sensor before the Sink "forgets" about the Sensor (stops maintaining a record of its attachment).  Although bindings are kept on the Sink node to track the attached Sensors, these could easily be made temporary (used only for the SINK_READY message) to allow the Sink application to support more nodes without englarging the binding table, assuming that the Sink application does not care which Sensors and how many Sensors are attached to it.
<li>The sensor advertisement is a broadcast.  The behavior of such a broadcast in the network depends on the network topology and density.  Zigbee limits the number of broadcasts that can be active in a network to 10 to minimize the network disruption and loss of bandwidth.  As this network increases in size or density, the rate of the sensor advertisement should be reduced in frequency.

<a name = "uart-tests"></a> <b>EZSP-UART Tests</b><br>
<i>Synopsis:</i><br>
Three test programs, uart-test-1, uart-test-2, and uart-test-3 are intended to trouble shoot the connection between a PC host computer and an NCP. The PC can be running either Linux or Windows with the Cygwin development tools installed.

<UL>
	<LI>The PC needs a 115200 bps serial connection to the NCP. This can be a standard UART, an external USB to RS232 adapter or the USB-RS232 adapter on the NCP EZSP-UART Breakout Board.
	<LI>To build the executables, go to the app/ezsp-uart-host/ directory and type:<BR>
	make uart-test-1 uart-test-2
	<LI>To run the programs, you must specify the PC serial port using the command line option -p followed by the name or number of the port. For example:<BR>
	./uart-test-1 -p COM5 <I>(Windows)</I><BR>
	./uart-test-1 -p 4 <I>(Linux)</I>
	<LI> uart-test-1 tests if there is basic connectivity between the host and the NCP
        <LI> uart-test-2 tests if EZSP frames can be exchanged between the host and the NCP
        <LI> uart-test-3 tests basic flow control: if the NCP can hold off the host by sending a frame that will overflow the NCP UART receive buffer unless flow control is working

<br>

<a name = "standalone-bootloader-demo-host"></a> <b>Standalone Bootloader Demo for Host processor</b><br>
<i>Synopsis:</i><br>
A sample application demonstrates over-the-air standalone bootloading feature and provides ability to upload new firmware to the network co-processor (NCP).  The application can be compiled and run on linux, cygwin (for window machines) or STM32F103RET microcontroller via provided Makefile and IAR project files. Only over-the-air passthru (remote) bootloading is supported in the application.  
<br>
<br>
<i>Buttons Used:</i> None
<br>
<br>
<i>Serial baud rates, ports used:</i> <br>
The standalone bootloader demo host application runs at 38400 bps and uses serial port 1 on the STM32F103RET microcontroller.  To initiate the application on the linux or cygwin (for window), the executable needs to first be copied or ftp onto the host machine. 
<br>
<br>
<i>Application Option and Usage:</i> <br>
Usage: standalone-bootloader-demo-gateway {ncp type} {options}
<br> use "-h" to see the available options
<br>
<br>
<i>Serial commands supported:</i> <br>
Once the application is running on the host processor, following serial commands can be used.  Use the <b>help</b> command to get a listing of all supported commands.  The command list is also printed here:
<ul>
	<li><b>help</b> - Prints this help menu
	<li><b>query network</b> - Send network wide query message
	<li><b>query neighbor</b> - Send query message to its neighbors only
	<li><b>query node [EUI in hex]</b> - Send query message to specified node
	<li><b>bootload serial-menu</b> - Enter bootload menu
	<li><b>bootload remote [target EUI]</b> - Perform over-the-air bootload on specified node
	<li><b>bootload recover [target EUI]</b> - Perform over-the-air bootload recovery on specified node on current channel
	<li><b>bootload default-recover</b> - Perform over-the-air bootload recovery on default channel 13
	<li><b>network form (args are optional) [channel] [power] [panid in hex]</b> - Form network
	<li><b>network join (args are optional) [channel] [power] [panid in hex]</b> - Join to network
	<li><b>network leave</b> - Leave network
	<li><b>info</b> - Display node information
	<li><b>reboot</b> - Reset host processor
</ul>
<br>
<i>Bootload Menu commands supported:</i> <br>
To get into bootload menu, enter serial command "bootload serial-menu" from the main application.  From this menu, user can put the network co-processor into bootload mode in order to upload new firmware.  The option list is also printed here:
<ul>
	<li><b>1</b> - Upload ncp app image(.ebl)
	<li><b>2</b> - Switch network co-processor to running bootloader via ESZP
	<li><b>3</b> - Switch network co-processor to running bootloader via reset
	<li><b>4</b> - Switch network co-processor to running NCP image via reset
	<li><b>5</b> - Get running stack version if NCP image is running or bootloader version if bootloader is running
	<li><b>6</b> - Exit bootload menu
<br>
</ul>
<i>Notes and Limitations:</i> 
<ul>
<li>This application assumes default bootload channel of 13 (decimal).
<li>This application only supports over-the-air remote bootloading via XMODEM protocol, cloning is not supported.
<li>EUI64 arguments are given as 16-character hexadecimal strings (with no enclosing characters), specified in LSB (least significant byte first) format.
<li>The application correctly reports on lack of over-the-air support on certain network co-processors (naming em35x-ezsp-uart and em35x-ezsp-spi) when the node is attempting to act as target node in the bootload process.  Message "NCP via EZSP-UART does not support OtA. Refusing to launch bootloader." is displayed when above network co-processors receive requests to go into bootload mode.
<li>If user attempts to send EZSP cmd to network co-processor while it is running bootloader, message "unsupported spi cmd" with  EZSP_SPI_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_SPI_COMMAND (0x1D) is displayed.  For EZSP UART network co-processor, the host will get ASH ack timeout error.
