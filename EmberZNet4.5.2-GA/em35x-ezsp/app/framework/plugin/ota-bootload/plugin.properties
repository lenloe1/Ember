name=OTA Cluster Platform Bootloader

description=This plugin provides the platform specific means to bootload a device.  For an SOC platform this will simply execute the bootloader.  In that case it is assumed that the SOC bootloader can access the same storage device as the run-time application using the bootload cluster (i.e. they both have the same EEPROM driver).  For the NCP, the code is more complex but functionally the same.  This host code will launch the bootloader on the NCP, transfer the file over to the NCP via the xmodem protocol, then reboot the NCP.  It is assumed for either NCP the serial standalone bootloader appropriate for the platform (UART or SPI) is loaded.  The NCP code requires an OTA Storage implementation and device.  This plugin does not support any host bootloading.
