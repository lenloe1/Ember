# Name of the plugin.
name=Trust Center Keepalive

# Description of the plugin.
description=Ember implementation of Trust Center Keepalive.  The plugin will periodically send keepalive signals to the trust center to verify that it is accessible.  If the trust center fails to acknowledge a series of keepalive signals, the plugin will search for another instance of the trust center.  The frequency with which the plugin sends the keepalive signals is configurable.  Trust Center Keepalive is part of the optional Trust Center Swap-Out feature of Smart Energy 1.1.  Devices are not required to implement this functionality.  The trust center does not send keepalives, so this plugin should be disabled if the device is acting as the trust center.
