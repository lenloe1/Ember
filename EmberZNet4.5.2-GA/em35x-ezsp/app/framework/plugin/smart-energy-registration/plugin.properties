# Name of the plugin.
name=Smart Energy Registration

# Description of the plugin.
description=Ember implementation of Smart Energy Registration.  The plugin will perform key establishment with the trust center when the node joins a network.  If the application implements Messaging, Price, or DRLC client clusters, the plugin will also discover ESIs on the network and perform partner link key exchange and binding with each ESI it discovers.  The number of ESIs supported by the plugin and the frequency with which ESIs are rediscovered are configurable.  These options are ignored if the application does not implement Messaging, Price, or DRLC client clusters.  Registration is not required for trust centers, so this plugin should be disabled if the device is acting as the trust center.
